# Manna for our Malices

A game I'm working on in ren'py.

You will need [ren'py](http://www.renpy.org) to play it based on a source checkout.

Builds are available from [itch.io](https://enkiv2.itch.io/manna-for-our-malices) and [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1013580/Manna_for_our_Malices/).

There is a [thread for this game on the lemmasoft forums](https://lemmasoft.renai.us/forums/viewtopic.php?f=43&t=45422&p=463206#p463206)

The [OpenShot project file](manna for our malices trailer.osp) is also available. Please note that in order to use this file in OpenShot, you will need to modify the paths inside manually.
