    ai "Yeah, just making some final adjustments."
    "The day after the incident, things calmed down almost immediately. I think the Others might have done us a favor and fogged some memories."
    ai "Alright, here I come!"
    "Mom" "Ai-chan, you look great in a yukata. Why don't you wear traditional clothes more often?"
    ai "Same reason you don't."

    ai "We shall."
    "Mom" "Oh, before you go -- I heard some news. That syndicate broke apart. You know, the one you used to go to for halloween? Such nice young men."
    ai "They were gangsters, mom."
    "Mom" "Even so! But it was funny. Apparently they schismed because of accusations that somebody embezzled 60 million yen."
    "Mom" "Nice house like that, you'd think they could afford to lose 60 million yen here and there."
    ai "Get to the point! I wanna eat the takoyaki while it's hot."
    "Mom" "Well anyway, don't go down there this year. It'll probably be dangerous."
    ai "Ok, I'll keep that in mind in six months."

    kuroneko "It sure looks like that to me."
    show aoi yukata pout at left
    "Aoi gives an exaggerated nod"
    ai "She's just... She's earnest and she tries really hard. It makes you want to protect her, you know? Like a kitten or something."
    kuroneko "Well, she's here but not with us. She came with her new boyfriend. Somebody from that facility."
    ai "That makes sense. Well, good for her."
    "A few stalls down on the far side, Mimi was kneeling at the goldfish game."
    ai "Hey, Aoi. Wanna catch me some goldfish?"

    "Aoi ran off down the path."
    kuroneko "That was certainly an adventure."
    ai "It was a fucking trip. You don't know the half of it."

    "Just then, Aoi returned with a bag full of goldfish in one arm and a blushing Yamada Mimi in the other."
    aoi "Look who I found!"
    mimi "G-Good evening."
    "I wink at Mimi. She scrunches her face in mock anger."
    ai "So the gang's pretty much all accounted for. I assume Shironeko-san's at home?"
    kuroneko "No way. Knowing her, she's already won all the prizes in the shooting gallery and is lording them over passing children."
