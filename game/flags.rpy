# Kuroneko's route unlocks some clues about the mechanisms by which the out of body time warp works.
# Objects or boundaries can be destroyed; one object shifts the time frame from May Eve 2012 to Halloween 2011,
# while another stops reincarnation entirely. Having another character get stabbed by the ceremonial knife will bring
# them into the time loop with you, and allow some state to be persistent with them. The good end involves warping back
# and forth between Halloween 2011 and May Eve 2012 to set things right (for instance, using knowledge about the 
# Yakuza group the Fujinomia family is indebted with, gained via their Halloween party) and setting the various 
# conspiracies against each other before breaking the time loop mechanism. Breaking the mechanism without fixing 
# all the conspiracies & rendering them harmless causes a bad end.
# Good end is a scene at the town's May Day festival. May day festivals would have been considered politically dangerous
# in Japan for a while, so maybe we can fill in why this one was allowed to exist in backstory.
