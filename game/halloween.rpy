# getting the yakuza to wipe debts requires Koneko to do touch telepathy, which means her arc needs to be complete
# Notes: all the unstuck characters are allowed into the general party because the bouncer (old, shaved head, leering) thinks they're hot
# however, to get physical access to the back room, we need to tell aoi to tell them she represents yomi poly & is there to broker a deal -- so we need to finish her arc too
# koneko sneaks up behind a high-ranking guy, touches him on the neck, and runs away. He suddenly gets up and yells at an underling:
# "Why the hell is the Fujinomiya debt still in this ledger?! They paid their sixty mil last week. Fix it right now and then go apologize, or you lose another finger!"
# koneko complains about how icky their brains are / how disgusting it is to connect to someone telepathically
# none of the girls are wearing a costume, but aoi is wearing cat ears
