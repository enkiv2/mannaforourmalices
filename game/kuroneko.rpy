# Notes on dagger mechanic:
# Stabbing someone with the ritual dagger forces their soul from their body but also kills anyone else who is unstuck
# So, unsticking someone else is fatal. This is the dagger's "kick"
# kick manifests as waves of nausea, dizziness, and then bleeding from the eyes

# Notes on kuroneko route in 2011:
# dying in 2011 will send you back to 2012 unless you also reverse the janus head there.
# kuroneko and ai sneak into the lodge in 2012 in order to find the book of shadows containing details about the ritual
# the section about how to abort the ritual safely has been torn out
# they go back to 2011 to fetch an earlier version & find it, using dagger & kick to jump to the beginning of halloween day. "sure is convenient, but it fuckin hurts don't it?"
# that version says that the altar must be destroyed during the ritual, after the first bar of music but before the third, and must be followed by a human sacrifice with the ritual dagger.
# this is endgame.
