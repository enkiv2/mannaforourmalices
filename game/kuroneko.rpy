# Notes on dagger mechanic:
# Stabbing someone with the ritual dagger forces their soul from their body but also kills anyone else who is unstuck
# So, unsticking someone else is fatal. This is the dagger's "kick"
# kick manifests as waves of nausea, dizziness, and then bleeding from the eyes

# Notes on kuroneko route in 2011:
# dying in 2011 will send you back to 2012 unless you also reverse the janus head there.
# kuroneko and ai sneak into the lodge in 2012 in order to find the book of shadows containing details about the ritual
# the section about how to abort the ritual safely has been torn out
# they go back to 2011 to fetch an earlier version & find it, using dagger & kick to jump to the beginning of halloween day. "sure is convenient, but it fuckin hurts don't it?"
# that version says that the altar must be destroyed during the ritual, after the first bar of music but before the third, and must be followed by a human sacrifice with the ritual dagger.
# this is endgame.

# Notes on endgame:
# ritual takes place near midnight walpurgisnacht, not may day proper
# kuroneko gets ai & the others robes so they can sneak in unnoticed
# shortly before the ritual begins, gunfire is heard. some cultists panic. cult leader tells them to continue, but there's tension whether or not it'll start
# ai & the others sneak into the altar room while kuroneko plays in a magic circle just outside the lodge proper
# she plays over loud gunshots and nearly hits the wrong note a couple times, but finally the first bar is finished and ai smashes the altar
# a sudden wind sweeps through, and parts of the lodge actually are blown off. the yakuza house next door catches fire but it's unclear if that's related.
# kuroneko runs in and says "we need to have a sacrifice, now!"
# options are (all of the unstuck) + "wait"
# all of the options other than aoi & wait end with ai being killed + general bad end
# picking aoi leads to an end where the world is saved but ai "killed aoi twice"/ wracked with guilt
# "wait" leads to kuroneko saying "we don't have any time, we need a sacrifice now"
# followed by a menu that's the same options but "wait" is replaced with "wait let me think"
# "wait let me think" gets a similar response, same menu but "wait" is now "there has to be another way"
# that leads to menu with "magic", "clones", "aliens"
# correct answer is clones; all others lead to killed by ritual blowback + bad end
# clones -> 
# ai "we need to get one of those clones!"
# aoi "you knew?"
# n "but how..."
# same menu again but now the right answer is aliens
# ai "koneko, can you contact the others?"
# koneko "yes, but..."
# ai "tell them i can give them all the headspace they need if they open a portal from here to the basement of the yomipoly biomedical research lab"
# aoi "you knew."
# portal opens
# ai hugs aoi as she goes to the portal
# ai "yes, i knew"
# ai goes into the portal and comes out carrying her clone
# koneko "okay tell them the rest of the deal quick because they're getting impatient"
# ai "tell them to take the drugs from the military facility they trashed and used them on the clones in that basement"
# ai "their hippocampuses"
# kuroneko "hippocami"
# ai "fuck you, hippocampuses. their hippocampuses ae fine but their cerebellums"
# kuroneko "cerebella"
# ai "are underclocked. their memory banks are functional but empty. they're already being used for organ storage so just use their brains too"
# kuroneko "they say okay"
# ai "alright i'm doing this"
# ai "i guess this is the end of my dream of a life full of junk food and heavy drinking with impunity"
# ai stabs her clone
# wind stops, sky clears, jump festival
# note: if halloween yakuza debt arc isn't cleared then gunshots & building on fire don't happen, rather than jump to festival we jump to another bad end where after defeating the ritual everyone goes to the fujinomia house to find their parents dead and more armed yakuza waiting for them
